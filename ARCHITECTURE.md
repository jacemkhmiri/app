# P2P Connect - Clean Architecture

This document describes the clean architecture implementation of the P2P Connect application.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
lib/
├── core/                           # Core functionality
│   ├── errors/                     # Error handling
│   ├── network/                    # Network utilities
│   └── usecases/                   # Base use case classes
├── features/                       # Feature-based modules
│   ├── auth/                       # Authentication feature
│   ├── chat/                      # Chat feature
│   ├── feed/                       # Social feed feature
│   └── home/                       # Home screen
├── shared/                         # Shared components
│   └── widgets/                    # Reusable widgets
└── services/                       # External services
    ├── p2p_connection_manager.dart
    ├── signaling_service.dart
    └── database_service.dart
```

## 📁 Feature Structure

Each feature follows the same structure:

```
features/[feature_name]/
├── data/                          # Data layer
│   ├── datasources/              # Data sources (local/remote)
│   └── repositories/             # Repository implementations
├── domain/                       # Domain layer
│   ├── entities/                 # Business entities
│   └── repositories/             # Repository interfaces
└── presentation/                 # Presentation layer
    ├── providers/                # State management
    ├── screens/                  # UI screens
    └── widgets/                  # Feature-specific widgets
```

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1. **Core Layer**
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with custom exceptions and failures
- **Network Info**: Connectivity checking utilities
- **Use Cases**: Base classes for business logic

### 2. **Domain Layer**
- **Entities**: Pure business objects with no dependencies
- **Repository Interfaces**: Abstract contracts for data access

### 3. **Data Layer**
- **Data Sources**: Local (SharedPreferences) and Remote (HTTP) data sources
- **Repository Implementations**: Concrete implementations of domain repositories

### 4. **Presentation Layer**
- **Providers**: State management using Provider pattern
- **Screens**: UI screens organized by feature
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components

## 🚀 Benefits of This Architecture

### ✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Each layer has a single responsibility
- Business logic is independent of UI and data sources
- Easy to test and maintain

### ✅ **Dependency Inversion**
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions (interfaces)
- Easy to swap implementations

### ✅ **Testability**
- Each layer can be tested independently
- Mock implementations can be easily created
- Business logic is isolated from external dependencies

### ✅ **Scalability**
- New features can be added without affecting existing code
- Clear boundaries between modules
- Easy to understand and navigate

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Code is organized and structured
- Changes are localized to specific layers
- Easy to refactor and extend

- P2P connections
- Message history

### **Feed**
- Post creation and sharing
- Like system

### **Home**
- Navigation between features
- Bottom navigation
- Floating action buttons

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### **Adding New Features**
1. Create feature directory under `features/`
2. Implement domain layer (entities, repository interfaces)
3. Implement data layer (data sources, repository implementations)
4. Implement presentation layer (providers, screens, widgets)
5. Register providers in main.dart

### **Error Handling**
- Use custom exceptions in data layer
- Convert to failures in repository layer
- Handle in presentation layer with user-friendly messages

### **State Management**
- Use Provider pattern for state management
- Keep business logic in providers
- Use repositories for data access

### **Testing**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for complete flows

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run Code Generation** (if needed)
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

3. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
